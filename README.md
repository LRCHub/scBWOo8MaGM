```lrc
[00:32.45] I remember the family PC
[00:36.15] There was snow in the hallways
[00:38.53] There was blood on my teeth
[00:41.98] Growing blind to the butterflies around me
[00:46.04] Knowing I'd remember it accurately
[00:51.99] Like a joke, I swear that I wrote
[00:55.82] I know I'm not alone and wondering
[01:01.24] The vertigo of tryna get close
[01:05.68] To who I was before remembering
[01:21.18] 
[01:19.35] And I want it to be wrong
[01:21.63] But it's over and done
[01:23.93] Is there really no happiness without this feeling?
[01:28.88] Give me a drug
[01:31.45] Bottled in love
[01:33.55] Is there really no happiness without you near me?
[01:38.67] It's so
[01:42.17] 
[01:50.82] Making love to the memory
[01:53.31] You'd think
[01:54.51] I've been chasing the track
[01:56.64] And you've been watching me weep
[02:00.46] Saying some things are better left remembered
[02:06.12] How's that help me?
[02:08.22] Well, maybe it's my fault
[02:10.73] 'Cause I'm so nostalgic
[02:13.01] There's some of my habits
[02:15.37] Had you sharing my accent
[02:17.92] And you're just like me
[02:20.53] I feel like I trained you
[02:22.63] I've been trying to change
[02:24.68] But I don't know how to change you
[02:27.85] Oh, woah-oh
[02:32.99] Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
[02:40.49] 
[02:37.54] And I want it to be wrong
[02:40.00] But it's over and done
[02:42.28] Is there really no happiness without this feeling?
[02:47.38] Give me a drug
[02:49.88] Bottled in love
[02:52.00] Is there really no happiness without you near me?
[02:57.23] It's so
[03:00.73] 
[02:59.67] (You know, Porter)
[03:01.56] (Some people die of nostalgia)
[03:05.36] (So you better look out)
[03:08.71] (Just kidding)
[03:13.24] (Good one!)
