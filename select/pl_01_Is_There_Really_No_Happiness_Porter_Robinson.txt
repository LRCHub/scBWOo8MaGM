I remember the family PC
There was snow in the hallways,
there was blood on my teeth
Growing blind to the butterflies
around me
Knowing
I'd remember it accurately
Like a joke,
I swear that I wrote
I know I'm not alone
and wondering
The vertigo of tryna get close
To who I was before remembering
And I want it to be wrong,
but it's over and done
Is there really no happiness
without this feeling?
Give me a drug, bottled in love
Is there really no happiness
without you near me?
It's so
Making love to the memory,
you'd think
I've been chasing the track
and you've been watching me weep
Saying some things are better
left remembered
How's that help me? Well,
maybe it's my fault
'Cause I'm so nostalgic
There's some of my habits,
had you sharing my accent
And you're just like me,
I feel like I trained you
I've been trying to change,
but I don't know
how to change you
And I want it to be wrong,
but it's over and done
Is there really no happiness
without this feeling?
Give me a drug, bottled in love
Is there really no happiness
without you near me?
It's so
You know, Porter
Some people die of nostalgia
So you better look out
Just kidding, haha
Good one
